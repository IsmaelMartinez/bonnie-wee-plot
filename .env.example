# This helps control costs while keeping the service free.

# OpenAI Model Configuration
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Cost-effective, fast, and excellent for gardening advice
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o     # More capable but more expensive alternative

# Setup Instructions:
# Option 1 (Recommended): Let users provide their own tokens
# - Don't add any API key below
# - Users will enter their own OpenAI API key in the app settings
# - This keeps your costs at zero while maintaining full functionality
#
# Option 2: Provide a shared API key (costs will be on you)
# 1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Create a new API key (name it "Community Allotment Aitor")
# 3. Copy the key (starts with 'sk-') and uncomment/paste it above
# 4. Save this file as .env.local
# 5. Restart your development server
# 
# Aitor uses OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model by default, which provides
# excellent gardening advice at a very reasonable cost.
