## Adding Your First Planting

Recording plantings helps you track what's in each bed and when to expect harvests.

### Steps

1. Go to **Seeds** or **Today**
2. Click **Add Planting** (or tap the + button on mobile)
3. Choose your plant from the catalogue
4. Select which bed or area
5. Add optional details:
   - Variety name (e.g., "San Marzano")
   - Sow date
   - How you started it (indoor sow, outdoor sow, purchased transplant)

### What Gets Calculated

Once you add a planting with a sow date, Bonnie Wee Plot automatically calculates:
- Expected transplant date (if applicable)
- Estimated harvest window
- Days until harvest

All dates are adjusted for Scottish growing conditions.

## Tracking Seeds

The **Seeds** page helps you manage your seed inventory across seasons.

### Seed Status Options

For each variety, track whether you:
- **Have** seeds ready to sow
- **Ordered** but waiting for delivery
- **Had** but need to reorder

### Why Track Seeds?

- Know at a glance what you can sow now
- Plan ahead by marking varieties you want to try
- Build a history of what varieties worked well

## Using the Calendar

**This Month** shows personalised guidance based on:
- Your location (Scotland-specific timing)
- What you've already planted
- Seasonal sowing windows

### Understanding the Calendar

- **Sow indoors**: Start seeds under cover (windowsill, greenhouse)
- **Sow outdoors**: Direct sow in prepared beds
- **Transplant**: Move seedlings to final positions
- **Harvest**: Expected picking time
