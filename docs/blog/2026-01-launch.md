# Introducing Progressive Disclosure: A Simpler Start for New Gardeners

*January 2026*

Bonnie Wee Plot just got a major update. If you've found the app overwhelming in the past, or if you're just getting started with allotment gardening, this release is for you.

## Start Simple, Grow Into More

The biggest change in this release is how the app welcomes new users. Instead of presenting every feature at once, Bonnie Wee Plot now starts you with just three pages: Today, This Month, and Seeds. These cover the essentials for most gardeners: what needs doing now, what's coming up soon, and tracking your seed collection.

As you use the app, additional features become available. Add your first planting and you'll unlock Ask Aitor, the AI advisor. Record a few more plantings and the Allotment Layout editor opens up. Record your first harvest and the Compost tracker appears. Each feature unlocks naturally as your garden grows.

Why this approach? We noticed that new users often felt lost when faced with fifteen different screens and options. By revealing features gradually, the app matches where you are in your gardening journey. A first-year plotholder who's just figuring out what to grow doesn't need the same interface as someone managing a complex crop rotation across six beds.

If you're an experienced user who wants immediate access to everything, there's an "Unlock now" button in the More menu for each feature. The progressive disclosure is a guide, not a gate.

## Meet Aitor: Your AI Gardening Companion

The AI advisor has been in Bonnie Wee Plot for a while, but this release makes it far more useful. Aitor can now update your garden records directly through conversation.

Say something like "I planted carrots in Bed A today" and Aitor will offer to add that planting to your records. You'll see exactly what change it proposes, and you confirm before anything is saved. The same works for updating plantings with harvest dates or removing entries you no longer need.

This makes managing your plot much faster when you're at the allotment with muddy hands. Instead of tapping through forms, you can speak naturally about what you're doing. Aitor handles the data entry.

The AI still provides the same gardening advice it always has, tuned specifically for Scottish conditions. Ask about pest problems, companion planting, when to sow your next crop, or why your brassicas look unhappy. You can even upload photos for plant identification or disease diagnosis.

To use Aitor, you'll need to provide your own OpenAI API key. This keeps the app free and ensures your conversations stay private. Keys are stored only in your browser.

## Welcome Experience for New Users

When you first open Bonnie Wee Plot, a gentle onboarding wizard now helps you find your feet. You'll choose from three paths based on what you want to do: see what's in season right now, set up your plot layout, or jump straight into asking Aitor questions.

Each path gives a brief explanation of what you'll find and a few tips for getting started. The whole experience takes less than a minute, but it sets you up with a clearer understanding of how the app fits your needs.

Existing users who already have data won't see the wizard. The app recognises you've been here before.

## Built for Scottish Growing Conditions

Everything in Bonnie Wee Plot is calibrated for Scotland's climate. When you add a planting and enter a sow date, the app calculates expected harvest dates using growth periods adjusted for Scottish day length and temperatures. For autumn sowings, it automatically adds extra days to account for the slower growth that comes with shorter days and cooler weather.

The seasonal calendar shows you what's genuinely appropriate to sow now, not what some generic gardening book written for the English Midlands suggests. When Aitor gives advice, it understands that "early spring" in Edinburgh isn't the same as London.

This matters because so much gardening information online assumes conditions that simply don't apply here. Bonnie Wee Plot won't tell you to sow tomatoes outdoors in March.

## Privacy by Design

Your data never leaves your device. Everything is stored in your browser's local storage. There's no account to create, no server storing your information, no tracking of what you grow.

The only exception is when you use Aitor. Your messages go to OpenAI's API using your own API key, processed according to their privacy policy. But your planting records, seed inventory, and layout stay entirely local.

This also means the app works offline. Once loaded, you can use it at the plot even with no mobile signal.

## Try It Now

Visit Bonnie Wee Plot and see the new experience for yourself. Whether you're planning your first bed or managing a full allotment, the app now meets you where you are and grows with you.

New features unlock as you use them. Aitor can update your records through conversation. And the whole thing stays free, private, and focused on Scottish growing conditions.

Happy growing.
