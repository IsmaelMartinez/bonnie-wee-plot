# Bonnie Wee Plot: Building a Garden Planner for Scottish Growers

*Draft blog post for launch*

## The Problem: Generic Gardening Apps Don't Work Here

If you've ever tried using a popular gardening app from your phone at the allotment, you'll know the frustration. "Sow tomatoes in March" they say - but in Scotland? That's two months too early for outdoor growing. The advice assumes a climate we simply don't have.

I wanted something different: a garden planner that **actually understands Scottish growing conditions**.

## What is Bonnie Wee Plot?

Bonnie Wee Plot is a free, open-source web app for planning and tracking your allotment. It runs entirely in your browser - no account needed, no data sent anywhere. Your garden stays yours.

### Key Features

**Scottish-Specific Timing**
Every sowing window, transplant date, and harvest estimate is calibrated for our shorter growing season and cooler climate. The app knows that "early spring" in Glasgow isn't the same as London.

**Track What Actually Matters**
- Record plantings with variety names and sow dates
- See calculated harvest windows based on your location
- Track seed inventory across seasons

**AI Gardening Advice**
Ask "Aitor" (our AI advisor) anything about gardening. It understands Scottish conditions and can help troubleshoot problems, suggest companion plants, or answer "what should I do with this bed next?"

**Works on Your Phone**
The app is designed mobile-first. Install it to your home screen and use it at the plot - even when signal is patchy.

## Why "Bonnie Wee Plot"?

The name is a nod to the Scottish allotment community. "Bonnie" because allotments are beautiful places. "Wee" because many of us work with compact plots. And "Plot" because that's what we're planning.

## Built in Public

Bonnie Wee Plot is open source. The code is on GitHub, and development happens in the open. If you're a developer interested in local-first web apps, Next.js, or garden tech - contributions are welcome.

For everyone else: just use it. It's free, it works without login, and it respects your privacy.

## What's Coming Next

The current version focuses on the essentials: plantings, seeds, and the calendar. We're working on:

- **AI-powered inventory management** - Tell Aitor "I planted carrots in bed A" and it updates your records
- **Progressive feature disclosure** - New users see a simple interface that grows with their needs
- **Better onboarding** - Guided first steps for new gardeners
